Welcome, I'm a new PyBuddy.

I'm Alice.
I'm a Species.CAT with 4 legs.
I weigh 8.12 kgs.
I've been alive for 0:00:00.000715.
I know:
  - Git
  - GitHub
  - Python
  - Markdown
  - VS Code

I love birds! My current favorite bird is the Northern Cardinal,
but it changes all the time!
I also love statistics! The mean weight of all the birds I saw
earlier is 10.32 grams. That would be 1.7 grams on the moon!

You'll need curiosity, the ability to search the web, 
and the tenacity and resourcefulness
to solve all kinds of challenges.
Let's get started!
